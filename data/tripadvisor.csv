His signature cocktails are incredibly creative, balanced, and dangerously crushable. He was even kind enough to walk us through some of his recipes and preparation process after the pre-dinner rush had passed. One of the highlights of our stay at the St Regis.",5

We only booked one night here during our stay at St. Regis. The setting is breathtaking with sunset and view of Mount Otemanu. Glass panels in the floor and lights let you see some undersea action. We saw, I think a shark, dart across our line of sight. We had a table next to the window.

Everything we ordered was like nothing we'd ever had before, and in a good way. Interesting combinations of flavors. And, in addition to what we ordered there were several additional items brought to our table. An incredibly satisfying meal, one of the best we have ever had. We even asked for the chef to come out so we could thank her personally and she did!

If you want to eat here book well in advance of your stay, it books up quick.

Arrive early for the sabering ritual.",5

Every aspect of the experience was perfect! The ambience, service and food were all top notch. The setting is just gorgeous. We started with drinks at sunset at 727 Bar which was amazing. Christian was our server 2 of the nights and he was perfection. We had stopped by to check out the menu the night before we first dined there and he brought us tea and snacks to relax with as we reviewed the menu and made us feel incredibly welcome. His impeccable knowledge of the menu, yet with a gentle presence and perfect timing each evening made our dining experience incredible. Our third night there with a different server was still great but not quite the amazing experience that we had with Christian. No fault of his, it's just that anyone after Christian will not be able to compare. I can't give him enough praise, as a server can make or break the evening. Lagoon is typically rated as the best restaurant in French Polynesia and for good reason. I could go on about each of the dishes, but they were all wonderful. The only things I would point out as a favorite is The Vanilla dessert. Sounds kind of boring, but it was divine.

I would like to point out something they did for us that showed they don't nickel and dime you at the St. Regis (which I hate when a resort does). We had a bottle of nice champagne in our room when we arrived for our anniversary. We wanted to have it with dinner one night since we tried to eat early enough to enjoy sunset each evening. We assumed they would either not allow us to bring it to dinner or charge a cork fee. Not only did they not charge a cork fee (since they had provided the champagne), they came and picked it up from our room and had it chilled for us to enjoy with dinner at The Lagoon. We didn't even have to remind them - they had it ready and knew it was for us. That is how you do things if you want to have raving fans. If you have an opportunity to eat here, just go and enjoy!!",5

The views and sunset from the bar is amazing, however make sure you have a hat and sunglasses as it can get very warm and hard on the eyes.

Service at diner was really good, they brought several ""amuse bouche"". I'm not big on fancy food or fish but my wife absolutely loved her meal, she said it was likely the best she ever had. I believe she had the Mahi Mahi has a main course. I had the chicken which was good. I had the chocolate cake for desert which was amazing! It takes 15 minutes as they bake it so if you don't want to wait, order it early. Again, views from the restaurant are amazing but we found that towards the end of the mail, the glare from the lights in the windows made it hard to see the mountain.

Unbelievable location and setting. Stunning views with a wonderful atmosphere and ambience. One evening, we even had the joy of watching a turtle swimming past in the crystal clear waters directly beneath us.

Fantastic cocktail list. Proper handcrafted drinks made by clearly very talented bar staff. If wine is your thing, the wine list appeared very extensive as well.

The food served here is some of the finest food I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The menu focuses mainly on local influences within fancy French cuisine. These two culinary styles are a match made in heaven and produce outstanding flavours. Simply put, every meal we ate here was of the absolute highest quality and some of the most delicious food we have ever eaten.

The service staff are warm, welcoming and beyond professional. Our waitress - Desi - was a true credit to the restaurant and really helped to make our meals and overall experience special each and every time.

Whilst it may not be cheap to dine here, it is worth it a thousand times over. I would still describe the restaurant as good value as there are many restaurants out there that charge a lot more for nowhere near this highest level of service and dining.

Without doubt, this is the best restaurant in Bora Bora and easily one of the best in the world. Not to be missed.",5

Our waitress, Maxine made sure everything was perfect. As an appetizer we did the tuna tataki with caviar and it was delicious. Perfectly citrusy and fresh. My husband and I did the ribeye for two. Words cannot express how tender and juicy Our steak was. We followed it with desert and some port. Overall, the culinary highlight of our trip.",5
